        <div class="blog font-1">
            <p>Today, an estimated one-third of all the food produced in the world goes to waste. That’s equal to
                about 1.3 billion tons of fruits, vegetables, meat, dairy, seafood, and grains that either never
                leave the farm, get lost or spoiled during distribution, or are thrown away in hotels, grocery
                stores, restaurants, schools, or home kitchens. It could be enough calories to feed every
                undernourished person on the planet. </p>
            <p>
                But wasted food isn't just a social or humanitarian concern—it's an environmental one. When we waste
                food, we also waste all the energy and water it takes to grow, harvest, transport, and package it.
                And if food goes to the landfill and rots, it produces methane—a greenhouse gas even more potent
                than carbon dioxide. About 6%-8% of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions could be reduced if we
                stop wasting food. In the US alone, the production of lost or wasted food generates the equivalent
                of 32.6 million cars’ worth of greenhouse gas emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the world’s population continues to grow, our challenge should not be how to grow more food, but
                to feed more people while wasting less of what we already produce. Thankfully, there are plenty of
                actions we can take at the consumer level to make a significant difference. From delivering
                leftovers to those in need to freezing food, shopping smarter, and composting to keep inedible
                scraps out of landfills, we can all take small steps to curb our emissions.

                Here are a few tips to help you get started:
            </p>
            <p>
                Plan ahead and buy only what you need. Going to the store without a plan or on an empty stomach can
                lead to buying more than we need. To keep your kitchen on track, try to eat leftovers, think of
                meals you might eat out, and avoid unnecessary purchases by planning your grocery list ahead of
                time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Use your freezer. While there are plenty of benefits to eating fresh food, frozen foods can be just
                as nutritious. They also stay edible for much longer. A lot of seafood, for example, is frozen
                before it reaches your supermarket and then thawed and put on display. That means it will only stay
                fresh for a few days. By buying frozen seafood, you can extend the shelf life of the product
                considerably. Cooking and freezing food—especially produce—before it goes bad is a great way to
                avoid having to toss it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Be creative with leftovers. Before you shop, use the food you already have. Websites like Big Oven,
                Supercook, and MyFridgeFood allow you to search for recipes based on ingredients already in your
                kitchen. You can also use apps like Epicurious and Allrecipes to make the most of what's in your
                fridge and pantry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Blend, bake, or boil. Fruits and vegetables that are beyond ripe may not look pretty, but that
                doesn't mean they can't still taste delicious in recipes. Try using your wilting, browning, or
                imperfect produce to make sweet smoothies, bread, jams, sauces, or soup stocks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Talk it up. Preventing food waste is the most effective way to shrink its impact on the planet. If
                we avoid producing food that we don't eat, we can save the land, water, and energy that would have
                been used to make it. And awareness is a good first step; according to ReFED, educating consumers
                about food waste could prevent 7.41 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
