            <h3>1) Perspective: There Are Many Different Angles</h3>
            <p>As we said right at the beginning, joy is a by-product,” the Archbishop
                began. “If you set out and say, I want to be happy, clenching your teeth
                with determination, this is the quickest way of missing the bus.” So if joy and
                happiness are by-products, what exactly are they by-products of? It was time to
                delve deeper into the qualities of mind and heart that we needed to cultivate to
                catch that bus. <br>
                “We have now covered the nature of true joy and the obstacles to joy,” I said
                as we began our fourth day of dialogues. “Now we are ready to move on to the
                positive qualities that allow us to experience more joy.” <br>
                We had discussed the topic of mental immunity in reducing fear and anger
                and other obstacles to joy, but the Dalai Lama had explained that mental
                immunity was also about filling our mind and heart with positive thoughts and
                feelings. As our dialogue progressed, we converged on eight pillars of joy. Four
                were qualities of the mind: perspective, humility, humor, and acceptance. Four
                were qualities of the heart: forgiveness, gratitude, compassion, and generosity.
                On the first day, the Archbishop had touched the fingers of his right hand to
                his heart to emphasize its centrality. We would end up, ultimately, at compassion
                and generosity, and indeed both men would insist that these two qualities were
                perhaps most pivotal to any lasting happiness. Yet we needed to begin with some
                fundamental qualities of the mind that would allow us to turn more easily and
                frequently to the compassionate and generous response to life. As the Dalai
                Lama had said at the start of our dialogues, we create most of our suffering, so
                we should be able to create more joy. The key, he had explained, was our
                perspective and the thoughts, feelings, and actions that come as a result.
                Scientific research consistently supported so much of the dialogue that was
                unfolding over the week. The factors that psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky has
                
                F
                found to have the greatest influence on our happiness supported a number of the
                eight pillars. The first concerned our perspective toward life, or, as Lyubomirsky
                described it, our ability to reframe our situation more positively. Our capacity to
                experience gratitude and our choice to be kind and generous were the others.
                A healthy perspective really is the foundation of joy and happiness, because
                the way we see the world is the way we experience the world. Changing the way
                we see the world in turn changes the way we feel and the way we act, which
                changes the world itself. Or, as the Buddha says in the Dhammapada, “With our
                mind we create our own world.” <br>
                
                
                
                or every event in life,” the Dalai Lama said, “there are many different
                angles. When you look at the same event from a wider perspective, your
                sense of worry and anxiety reduces, and you have greater joy.” The Dalai Lama
                had discussed the importance of a wider perspective when he was telling us
                about how he was able to see the calamity of his losing his country as an
                opportunity. It was jaw-dropping to hear him “reframe more positively” the last
                half century of exile. He had been able to see not only what he had lost but also
                what he had gained: wider contact and new relationships, less formality and
                more freedom to discover the world and learn from others. He had concluded,
                “So therefore, if you look from one angle, you feel, Oh, how bad, how sad. But
                if you look from another angle at that same tragedy, that same event, you see
                that it gives me new opportunities.” <br>
                Edith Eva Eger tells the story of visiting two soldiers on the same day at
                William Beaumont Army Medical Center at Fort Bliss. Both were paraplegics
                who had lost the use of their legs in combat. They had the same diagnosis and
                the same prognosis. The first veteran, Tom, was lying on his bed knotted into a
                fetal position, railing against life and decrying his fate. The second, Chuck, was
                out of bed in his wheelchair, explaining that he felt as if he had been given a
                second chance in life. As he was wheeled through the garden, he had realized
                that he was closer to the flowers and could look right into his children’s eyes.
                Eger often quotes fellow Auschwitz survivor Viktor Frankl, who said that our
                perspective toward life is our final and ultimate freedom. She explains that our
                perspective literally has the power to keep us alive or to cause our death. One of
                her fellow inmates at Auschwitz was terribly ill and weak, and others in her
                bunk asked her how she was holding on to life. The prisoner said that she had
                heard that they were going to be liberated by Christmas. The woman lived
                against all odds, but she died on Christmas Day when they were not liberated. <br>
                
                
                It’s no wonder that during the week the Dalai Lama had called some thoughts
                and feelings toxic, even poisonous. <br>
                Jinpa explained that while changing our emotions is quite hard, changing our
                perspective is actually relatively easy. It is a part of our mind, over which we
                have influence. The way you see the world, the meaning you give to what you
                witness, changes the way you feel. It can be the first step of “a spiritual and
                neural journey that results in more and more equanimity and of our default state
                being increasingly more joyful,” as psychologist and writer Daniel Goleman
                poetically put it on a pretrip call. Perspective, Jinpa argued, is nothing less than
                the skull key that opens all of the locks that imprison our happiness. What is this
                perspective shift that has such power? What is the healthy perspective that the
                Dalai Lama and the Archbishop bring to life, that allows them to greet life with
                so much joy in the face of so much sorrow? <br>
                
                
                he Dalai Lama used the terms wider perspective and larger perspective.
                They involve stepping back, within our own mind, to look at the bigger 
                
                picture and to move beyond our limited self-awareness and our limited self-
                interest. Every situation we confront in life comes from the convergence of
                
                many contributing factors. The Dalai Lama had explained, “We must look at any
                given situation or problem from the front and from the back, from the sides, and
                from the top and the bottom, so from at least six different angles. This allows us
                to take a more complete and holistic view of reality, and if we do, our response
                will be more constructive.” <br>
                We suffer from a perspectival myopia. As a result, we are left nearsighted,
                unable to see our experience in a larger way. When we confront a challenge, we
                often react to the situation with fear and anger. The stress can make it hard for us
                to step back and see other perspectives and other solutions. This is natural, the
                Archbishop emphasized throughout the week. But if we try, we can become less
                fixated, or attached, to use the Buddhist term, to one outcome and can use more
                skillful means to handle the situation. We see that in the most seemingly limiting
                circumstance we have choice and freedom, even if that freedom is ultimately the
                attitude we will take. How can a trauma lead to growth and transformation? How
                can a negative event actually become positive? We were being invited to see the
                blessing in the curse, the joy in the sorrow. Jinpa offered a silver-lining thought
                experiment to take us out of our limited perspective: Take something bad that
                happened in the past and then consider all the good that came out of it. <br>
                
                But is this simply being Pollyanna? Are we seeing the world less clearly
                when we view it through these rose-colored glasses? I do not think anyone
                would accuse the Dalai Lama or Archbishop Tutu of not seeing the struggles
                they have faced or the horrors of our world with keen and unflinching vision.
                What they are reminding us is that often what we think is reality is only part of
                the picture. We look at one of the calamities in our world, as the Archbishop
                suggested, and then we look again, and we see all those who are helping to heal
                those who have been harmed. This is the ability to reframe life more positively
                based on a broader, richer, more nuanced perspective. <br>
                With a wider perspective, we can see our situation and all those involved in a
                larger context and from a more neutral position. By seeing the many conditions
                and circumstances that have led to this event, we can recognize that our limited
                perspective is not the truth. As the Dalai Lama said, we can even see our own
                role in any conflict or misunderstanding. <br>
                By stepping back we can also see the long view, and have a clearer
                understanding of our actions and our problems in the larger frame of our life.
                This allows us to see that even though our situation may seem challenging now,
                from the vantage point of a month or a year or a decade these challenges will
                seem much more manageable. When the Archbishop was awarded the
                Templeton Prize in London, I had the opportunity to meet the astronomer royal
                of the United Kingdom, Sir Martin Rees, who explained to me that our Earth
                
                will exist for an equivalent amount of time as it has taken us to go from one-
                celled organisms to human beings—in other words, we are only halfway through
                
                our evolution on this planet. Thinking of our world’s problems in this long
                sweep of planetary history really is the long view. It puts our daily concerns into
                a much broader perspective. <br>
                
                This wider perspective also leads us beyond our own self-regard. Self-
                centeredness is most of our default perspective. It comes quite understandably
                
                from the fact that we are at the center of our world. But as the Dalai Lama and
                the Archbishop demonstrate so powerfully, we also have the ability to take on
                the perspectives of others. <br>
                I remembered the Archbishop wondering if the person who had cut him off in
                traffic might be rushing to the hospital because his wife was giving birth or
                because a loved one was dying. “I have sometimes said to people,” the
                Archbishop said, “when you are stuck in a traffic jam, you can deal with it in one
                of two ways. You can let the frustration really eat you up. Or you can look
                around at the other drivers and see that one might have a wife who has
                pancreatic cancer. It doesn’t matter if you don’t know exactly what they might
                have, but you know they are all suffering with worries and fears because they are
                
                human. And you can lift them up and bless them. You can say, Please, God, give
                each one of them what they need. <br>
                “The very fact of not thinking about your own frustration and pain does
                something. I don’t know why. But it will make you feel much better. And I think
                it has therapeutic consequences for your own health, physical and spiritual. But
                what does frustration help? I mean, you feel it in the pit of your tummy, the
                anger. I mean, you just get more angry, and after a while you are going to
                develop ulcers in the stomach from the fact that you got annoyed at sitting in a
                traffic jam.” <br>
                Taking a “God’s-eye perspective,” as the Archbishop might say, allows us to
                transcend our limited identity and limited self-interest. One does not have to
                believe in God to experience this mind-altering shift in perspective. The famous
                Overview Effect is perhaps the most profound example. Many astronauts have
                reported that once they glimpsed Earth from space—a small blue ball floating in
                the vast expanse, lacking our human-made borders—they never looked at their
                personal or national interests in quite the same way again. They saw the oneness
                of terrestrial life and the preciousness of our planetary home. <br>
                Fundamentally, the Dalai Lama and the Archbishop were trying to shift our
                perspective from focusing on I and me and mine to we and us and ours. Earlier in
                the week the Dalai Lama had referenced a classic study that suggested the
                constant use of personal pronouns leads to a greater risk of heart attack. In a
                multicenter prospective study of coronary heart disease, health researcher Larry
                Scherwitz found that people who more frequently said I, me, or mine had a
                higher risk of having a heart attack and had a higher risk of their heart attack
                being fatal. Scherwitz found that this so-called “self-involvement” was a better
                predictor of death than smoking, high cholesterol levels, or high blood pressure.
                A more recent study conducted by researcher Johannes Zimmerman found that
                people who more often use first-person singular words—I and me—are more
                likely to be depressed than people who more often use first-person plural—we
                and us. This was interesting evidence that being too self-regarding really does
                make us unhappy. <br>
                When we have a wider perspective, we are also less likely to spend our time
                lost in self-referential thoughts, ruminating. Jinpa offered another thought
                experiment designed to take us out of our self-absorption, one that the
                Archbishop described using when he was in the hospital being treated for
                prostate cancer, and that the Dalai Lama used when he was doubled over in pain
                from a gallbladder infection: Think about where you are suffering in your life
                and then think about all the other people who are going through a similar
                situation. This perhaps is quite literally the birth of compassion, which means
                
                “suffering with.” The incredible thing, the Dalai Lama and the Archbishop
                pointed out, was that this “suffering with” others reminds us that we are not
                alone, and actually lessens our own pain. This recognition of our
                interdependence begins to soften our rigid sense of self, the boundaries that
                separate us from others. The Dalai Lama had said earlier in the week, “If, on the
                other hand, I relate to others from the perspective of myself as someone different
                —a Buddhist, a Tibetan, and so on—I will then create walls to keep me apart
                from others.” <br>
                We were back at the conversation that began the week, when we had just
                gotten off the airplane and were sitting in the lounge of the airport. The Dalai
                Lama had asked, “Where is Bishop Tutu’s self? We can’t find it.” The Dalai
                Lama, in a traditional twist of Buddhist reasoning, said, “This is his body, but
                not himself. This is his mind, but not himself.” Buddhists follow this line of
                inquiry to reduce our attachment to our identity, recognizing that the less
                attached we are, the less defensive and reactive we will be and the more effective
                and skillful we can be. <br>
                As the Dalai Lama and the Archbishop explained, the wider perspective leads
                to serenity and equanimity. It does not mean we don’t have the strength to
                confront a problem, but we can confront it with creativity and compassion rather
                than rigidity and reactivity. When we take the perspective of others, we can
                empathize with them. One starts to see the interdependence that envelops us all,
                which reveals that how we treat others is ultimately how we treat ourselves. We
                also are able to recognize that we do not control all aspects of any situation. This
                leads to a greater sense of humility, humor, and acceptance.</p>
