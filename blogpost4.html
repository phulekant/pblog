        <h3>Author: Yuval Noah Harrari</h3>
        <div class="blog font-1">
            By rights, Yuval Noah Harari should be an anonymous academic buried in an obscure university department
            somewhere toiling away on his somewhat dusty discipline – medieval military history. He’s a professor of
            history at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and there is almost nothing in his background to suggest that
            he would write a book that has become one of the most talked about non-fiction bestsellers of the year –
            Sapiens. Or that he’d join the globetrotting TED-ocracy: the academic superstars who travel the world
            delivering keynotes on zeitgeisty topics, in Harari’s case, the not inconsiderable subject of the history of
            the whole of mankind. <br>

            He’s just been the star turn at Penguin Random House’s global sales conference. In May, he
            packed out Hay. Earlier this month, he delivered a TED talk. And last month, he received the ultimate
            imprimatur when Sapiens was selected by Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, for his online book club.
            He’s invited his 38 million followers to read what he describes as “a big history narrative of human
            civilisation– from how we developed from hunter-gatherers to how we organise our society and economy today”.
<br>
           

            The Sapiens book was based on an introductory course on world history he taught when none of his more senior
            colleagues wanted to take it on, and it was turned down by almost every major publishing outfit in Israel
            before finding a receptive editor. Since then, however, its success has been swift and resounding: it became
            a bestseller in Israel and has gone on to be published in 20 countries around the world. But then, the
            book’s success, and the way that Harari has been taken up by the global tastemakers, makes sense in that he
            considers himself a historian of globalisation. “In a way, it’s like in the 19th century with the rise of
            nationalism. You establish an independent national state and the first thing you do is to write a history of
            that state. Now we have a more global world, you need the history of the whole of the global world, not of a
            particular country, or religion, but the history of humankind as a whole.”
<br>
            This is entirely characteristic of the way that Harari speaks. In full sentences, paragraphs, even. My
            transcript, which is usually a mess of elipses, reads like it’s been lifted off the page. And his book is a
            brilliant read. He zips from subject to subject, through thousands of years of human history, alighting on
            whatever seems to take his fancy but gradually builds up a picture of us as… well, as what exactly? As more
            successful monkeys, basically, so successful that we’ve enslaved all the other animals and bent the planet
            to our will. But whereas sharks and lions evolved over millennia to take their place at the top of the food
            chain, Harari compares us to “banana republic dictators” who just got here. “They came to power very
            violently and lately so they feel extremely insecure about their position. So all the time they just take
            more and more power to beef up their position.”
<br>
            A chimpanzee alpha male would never think of using his power in order to go on holiday into the territory of
            a neighbouring chimpanzee band.
            A chimpanzee alpha male would never think of using his power in order to go on holiday into the territory of
            a neighbouring chimpanzee band.
            <br>

            Because, in Harari’s view, we have no real idea what we want even at the most basic, personal level, let
            alone as a species. “Even what people take to be their most personal desires are usually programmed by the
            imagined order.” There’s nothing “natural or obvious” about taking a holiday abroad, he says by way of
            example. “A chimpanzee alpha male would never think of using his power in order to go on holiday into the
            territory of a neighbouring chimpanzee band. The elite of ancient Egypt spent their futures building
            pyramids and having their corpses mummified but none of them thought of going shopping in Babylon.” We’re
            all victims of the “myths of romantic consumerism”, he says.
<br>
            But everything is a myth, a story, according to Harari. Justice is a story. Human rights are a story. Money,
            he told the moneyed elite at TED, is “the greatest story ever told”. So what’s your story?
<br>
            “About the history of the world?”
<br>

            Yuval Harari on Sapiens. <br>
            No, about you. Your story, about yourself. <br>

            “Oh, myself? For me, I suppose the most important thing is the search for the truth. I really want to
            understand reality, what’s really happening here. As far back as I remember, this was something that I was
            extremely preoccupied by. I remember in high school asking my parents and my teachers to explain what’s
            happening here, what is life, what’s it all about, and so forth. <br>

            “What struck me most was not that they didn’t tell me an answer but that they weren’t really concerned about
            it. Many people in their teens wonder about these big questions, what’s the meaning of life, what are we
            doing here, then somewhere in their 20s they seem to say, ‘I’ll just get married. I’ll just have kids. I’ll
            get back to that later.’ But they never do. For me, it kept boiling. And it still is boiling.” <br>

         
            He grew up in a secular Jewish family of eastern European origin in the Haifa area and there are a few
            things he recognises about himself that have informed his world view, or at least his desire to question
            other people’s view of the world. The first is being gay.
            <br>

            “You don’t take the accepted view for granted just because everybody believes it. It really affects the way
            that I view everything. Nothing should be taken for granted even if everybody believes it. It forces you to
            look at society a bit from the side.”
            <br>

            Another influence was the collapse of the Berlin Wall when he was a teenager in 1989.
<br>
            “It means I don’t take capitalism and neo-liberalism for granted. I teach all these 20-year-old students and
            they were born into a capitalist world. It’s the only system. There’s no alternative and nobody can even
            imagine that there could be. But I remember the time when these things were really hotly contested. And also
            the way that you can live in a certain type of world and be sure that this will go on for ages and ages and
            suddenly everything collapses.” <br>

            In some ways, I say, it struck me that Sapiens isn’t actually a history book – it’s a philosophy book that
            asks the big, philosophical questions and attempts to answer them through history. <br>

            “Yes, that’s a very accurate description. I think that I see history as a philosophy laboratory.
            Philosophers come up with all these very interesting questions about the human condition, but the way that
            most of them – though not all – go about answering them is through thought experiments. But if you’re
            interested in, say, justice, history is full of empirical evidence about justice in human society.” <br>

        

            It’s no surprise, either, that he’s come to the attention of Mark Zuckerberg. Harari is one of the very few
            thinkers around who’s really looking at what’s happening now. Sapiens is his attempt to tell the story of
            the past to understand the present: the great technological advances that we are all living through now. <br>

            The way you tell it is that we’re at a point of inflection: that we’re on the cusp of perhaps the greatest
            change for the human race ever? <br>

            “Probably, yes. I mean the one thing that has remained constant in history was humans themselves. Homo
            sapiens, you and me, we are basically the same as people 10,000 years ago. The next revolution will change
            that.” <br>

            The “next revolution”, as Harari sees it, the latest in a line that began with the cognitive revolution and
            takes in the agricultural revolution and the scientific revolution, is what is happening in the biotech
            field, in artificial intelligence. <br>

            “When people talk about merging with computers to create cyborgs, it’s not some prophecy about the year
            2200. It’s happening right now. More and more of our reality exists within computers or through them.” <br>

            But this is only the start of it. For the first time in history, “we will see real changes in humans
            themselves – in their biology, in their physical and cognitive abilities”. And while we have enough
            imagination to invent new technologies, we are unable to foresee their consequences. <br>

            “It was the same with the agricultural revolution about 10,000 years ago. Nobody sat down and had a vision:
            ‘This is what agriculture is going to be for humankind and for the rest of the planet.’ It was an
            incremental process, step by step, taking centuries, even thousands of years, which nobody really understood
            and nobody could foresee the consequences.” <br>

            I do find it worrying that the future of humankind is now in the hands of a very small group of
            entrepreneurs
            Yuval Noah Harari
            Only now, the decisions are being taken by “a small international caste of business people, entrepreneurs
            and engineers”. Governments have become “managers”, he says. They have no vision, “whereas meet the people
            in Google, in Facebook, they have tremendous visions about the future, about overcoming death, living for
            ever, merging humans with computers. I do find it worrying that the basis of the future, not only of
            humankind, the future of life, is now in the hands of a very small group of entrepreneurs.” <br>

      
            But then, even those of us who are aware of the arguments aren’t necessarily losing sleep over it, a fact
            that Harari puts down to one of our unique attributes as humans: our cognitive dissonance, our ability to
            hold two utterly conflicting ideas in our heads at the same time. That we can say, what a cute dog and yum,
            yum, what a delicious steak and not see a problem with that somehow. <br>



            His views on inequality – that the 20th century was a blip basically; we’ve always been unequal and we’re
            heading back that way – link him to that other great intellectual du jour, Thomas Piketty, but much of
            Sapiens feels inventively original, a fact that he puts down to his longstanding interest in meditation.
            Harari, it seems, doesn’t succumb to the myth of romantic consumerism when it comes to deciding what to do
            on his holidays. Last summer, he went on a 60-day silent vipassana retreat. He discovered it at Oxford when
            researching his PhD. <br>

    

            It’s an interest that he shares with the Silicon Valley types he critiques (Steve Jobs was a practitioner of
            Zen Buddhism) and, in a distracted age, focus – and its handmaiden, mindfulness – is more fashionable in
            west-coast America than curly kale. But without meditation, he says, “I would probably be far less satisfied
            and happy. And I would probably be a far worse historian. I suppose I would still be researching medieval
            military history, but not the neanderthals or cyborgs.” <br>

            It’s bracing, Harari’s focus on the big things. His next book is “about the human agenda for the 21st
            century in terms of dangers, opportunities, questions”. Mark Zuckerberg will no doubt read it. Probably the
            rest of us should too. <br>
