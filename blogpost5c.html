            <h3>3) Humor: Laughter, Joking Is Much Better</h3>
            <p>
                One of the most stunning aspects of the week was how much of it was spent
                laughing. At times the Dalai Lama and the Archbishop seemed to be as
                much a comedy duo as two venerable spiritual teachers. It is their ability to joke,
                and laugh, and poke fun at the ordinary pieties that so righteously violates
                expectation. When a Dalai Lama and an Archbishop walk into a bar, you don’t
                expect them to be the ones cracking the jokes. Having worked with many
                spiritual leaders, I’m tempted to see laughter and a sense of humor as a universal
                index of spiritual development. The Archbishop and the Dalai Lama were
                certainly at the top of that index, and they skewered humbug, status, injustice,
                and evil, all with the power of humor. They and everyone around them were
                constantly guffawing, chortling, giggling, and belly laughing throughout the
                week, as moments of great levity were spliced together with moments of
                profundity and sanctity. So often their first response to any subject, no matter
                how seemingly painful, was to laugh. <br>
                It was clear that humor was central to their joyful way of being, but why was
                laughter so central? <br>
                “I worked with a Mexican shaman once,” I said, introducing the topic. “He
                said that laughing and crying are the same thing—laughing just feels better. It’s
                clear that laughter is central to the way that you are in the world. And the
                Archbishop was just saying, Your Holiness, that you laugh at something that
                could ordinarily be a source of anguish.” <br>
                “That’s right. That’s right.” <br>
                “Can you tell us about the role of laughter and humor in the cultivation of
                joy?” <br>
                “It is much better when there is not too much seriousness,” the Dalai Lama
                responded. “Laughter, joking is much better. Then we can be completely
                relaxed. I met some scientists in Japan, and they explained that wholehearted
                laughter—not artificial laughter—is very good for your heart and your health in

                general.” When he said “artificial laughter,” he pretended to smile and forced a
                chuckle. He was making a connection between wholehearted laughter and a
                warm heart, which he had already said was the key to happiness. <br>
                I once heard that laughter was the most direct line between any two people,
                and certainly the Dalai Lama and the Archbishop used humor to break down the
                social barriers that separate us. Humor, like humility, comes from the same root
                word for humanity: humus. The lowly and sustaining earth is the source for all
                three words. Is it any surprise that we have to have a sense of humility to be able
                to laugh at ourselves and that to laugh at ourselves reminds us of our shared
                humanity? <br>
                “I think that the scientists are right,” the Dalai Lama concluded. “People who
                are always laughing have a sense of abandon and ease. They are less likely to
                have a heart attack than those people who are really serious and who have
                difficulty connecting with other people. Those serious people are in real danger.”
                “We found at home . . .” the Archbishop added, gazing down thoughtfully,
                remembering those painful times, “when we were conducting funerals of people
                who had been killed by the police, we would have hundreds and hundreds of
                people attending the funerals. It was a state of emergency—you were not
                allowed any other gatherings—so the funerals turned into political rallies. We
                found that one of the best ways of helping our people direct their energies in
                positive directions was laughter. Telling jokes, even at our expense, was such a
                wonderful flip to our morale. Of course some of the things that happened were
                just so horrendous. Like I was saying yesterday, about Chris Hani, humor helped
                to defuse a very, very tense situation, telling stories that made people laugh and
                especially to laugh at themselves. <br>
                “People were really angry and you’d have the police standing not far away—
                and it was an explosive situation. Anything could have gone wrong. My
                weaponry, if you can call it that, was almost always to use humor, and especially
                self-denigrating humor, where you are laughing at yourself. <br>
                “We came to a township just outside of Johannesburg, where the apartheid
                forces had provided weapons to one group, and they had killed quite a number of
                people. We were having a meeting of bishops close by, and I was part of those
                leading the funeral of the victims of that massacre. The people were obviously
                extremely angry, and I remembered a story that had been told about how at the
                beginning of creation, God molded us out of clay and then put us into a kiln, like
                you do with bricks. God put one lot in and then got busy with other things and
                forgot about those he had put into the kiln. And after a while he remembered and
                rushed to the kiln, where the whole lot was burned to cinders. They say this is
                how we black people came about. Everyone laughed a little. And then I said,

                ‘Next, God put in a second lot, and this time he was overanxious and opened the
                oven too quickly, and this second lot that came out was underdone. And that’s
                how white people came about.’” The Archbishop finished with a little laugh and
                then that cackle that climbs up the flagpole and back down. <br>
                “We tend to want to blow ourselves up, inflate ourselves because most of us
                have tended to have a poor self-image. When you’re in a situation such as the
                one in South Africa where you were discriminated against, it was very easy to
                lose your sense of self, and humor seems to do something for people. Humor
                certainly did one good thing: it deflated, defused a particularly tense situation.”
                The Archbishop had visited Rwanda shortly after the genocide and was asked
                to give a talk to the Hutus and the Tutsis. How does one talk about a wound that
                is so fresh in the soul of a people? The Archbishop’s solution, as it so often is,
                was to speak truth to power—through humor. He began telling a story about the
                big-nose people and the small-nose people and how the big-nose people were
                excluding the small-nose people. The people in the audience were laughing, and
                as they were laughing they suddenly realized what he was talking about: the
                ridiculousness of prejudice and hatred, whether in his country or theirs. Humor
                was, as he said, a very powerful weapon. <br>
                The Dalai Lama visited Belfast in northern Ireland after the Troubles. He was
                invited to attend a private meeting where victims and perpetrators of violence
                were present. The atmosphere was very tense, as the suffering was practically
                palpable in the air. As the meeting began, a former Protestant militant spoke of
                how, when he was growing up, he was told by other loyalists that what they did
                in opposition to the Catholics was justified because Jesus was a Protestant and
                not a Catholic. Knowing that Jesus was, of course, a Jew, the Dalai Lama
                laughed so hard that he completely changed the atmosphere. Able to laugh at the
                absurdity of our prejudices and our hatreds, everyone was able to communicate
                more honestly and compassionately with each other. <br>
                “When we learn to take ourselves slightly less seriously,” the Archbishop
                continued, “then it is a very great help. We can see the ridiculous in us. I was
                helped by the fact that I came out of a family who did like to take the mickey out
                of others, and who were quite fond of pointing out the ridiculous, especially
                when someone was being a bit hoity-toity. And they had a way of puncturing
                your sense of self-importance. <br>
                “I mean, of course it’s not a laughing matter not to know where your next
                meal is going to come from. It’s not a laughing matter when you get up in the
                morning and you don’t have a job. Yet it was those people who quite frequently
                were the ones who formed part of the crowds that used to come to the political
                rallies, the funerals. And they were the people who were able to laugh at

                themselves. And then their laughing at others would be less malicious. They
                weren’t particularly number one in God’s garden, but they were able to laugh at
                life in all its cruelty and uncertainty. Humor really is the saving grace.
                “I have been helped by my wife, Leah, who was very—is very—good at
                keeping me humble. Once, we were driving, and I noticed that she was a little
                smugger than she normally is. And then when I looked again at the car in front
                of us, I saw a bumper sticker that said: ‘Any woman who wants to be equal to a
                man has no ambition.’” <br>
                “Archbishop,” I said, “humor can also be very cruel. But your humor, as I’ve
                seen over the years, is about bringing us together, not about separating us and
                putting anyone down—except maybe the Dalai Lama. But most of the time it’s
                about uniting. Can you two tell us a little bit about the ways in which humor can
                bring us together and show us our shared ridiculousness?” <br>
                “Well, yes, if you are longing to bring people together, you’re not going to do
                so by being acerbic. You know, it’s so good to see the ridiculous in us all, really.
                I think we then get to see our common humanity in many ways. <br>
                “Ultimately, I think it’s about being able to laugh at yourself and being able
                not to take yourself so seriously. It’s not about the belittling humor that puts
                others down and yourself up. It’s about bringing people onto common ground.
                “If you can manage to downgrade yourself, if you are able to laugh at
                yourself and get others to laugh at you without feeling guilty that they are
                laughing at you. The humor that doesn’t demean is an invitation to everyone to
                join in the laughter. Even if they’re laughing at you they’re joining you in a
                laughter that feels wholesome.” <br>
                “When you and the Dalai Lama tease each other,” I added, “it does not feel
                demeaning at all.” <br>
                “Yes, the Dalai Lama and I tease each other, but it is a statement of trust in
                the relationship. It’s an indication that there’s enough of a reservoir of goodwill
                that you’re really saying, ‘I trust you. And you trust me that I know you will not
                undermine me or be offended by me.’ <br>
                “I’m just thinking that we’re so very apt to belittle because we are also so
                unsure of ourselves and we think that the best way of asserting who we are is by
                putting you down, whereas this kind of humor says, ‘Come stand next to me and
                let’s laugh at me together, then we can laugh at you together.’ It does not belittle
                either of us but uplifts us, allows us to recognize and laugh about our shared
                humanity, about our shared vulnerabilities, our shared frailties. Life is hard, you
                know, and laughter is how we come to terms with all the ironies and cruelties
                and uncertainties that we face.” <br>
                <br>
                Scientific research on humor is rather limited, but it does seem that there is
                an evolutionary role for laughter and humor in managing the anxiety and stress
                of the unknown. Jokes are funny precisely because they break our expectations
                and help us to accept the unexpected. Other people are one of the greatest
                sources of uncertainty in our lives, so it is not surprising that much humor is
                used to manage and massage these encounters. The Archbishop and the Dalai
                Lama are masters of using humor to connect and join together when meeting
                others. <br>
                Perhaps that is one of the reasons that their time together was so filled with
                laughter. For all the joy they felt being together, it was an unprecedented and no
                doubt uncertain experience to meet for a week together in Dharamsala. They had
                met only a half dozen times before, and these were largely brief and formal
                occasions. Global leaders have full schedules, and their times together are highly
                scripted, so an opportunity to just joke and be themselves was exceedingly rare.
                “What do you say to people,” I asked the Archbishop, “who say they are not
                funny or that they do not have a good sense of humor?” <br>
                “I reckon there are many people who think they have to be somber because it
                gives them gravitas, and they feel they are more likely to be respected if they are
                serious. But I believe very fervently that one of the ways of getting into the
                hearts of people is the capacity of making them laugh. If you are able to laugh at
                yourself, then everyone knows you’re not pompous. Besides, you hardly ever
                knock down someone who is knocking himself down. You’re not likely to
                clobber someone if they’ve already, as it were, self-clobbered. <br>
                “I don’t think I woke up and presto I was funny. I think it is something that
                you can cultivate. Like anything else, it is a skill. Yes, it does help if you have
                the inclination, and especially if you can laugh at yourself, so learn to laugh at
                yourself. It’s really the easiest place to begin. It’s about humility. Laugh at
                yourself and don’t be so pompous and serious. If you start looking for the humor
                in life, you will find it. You will stop asking, Why me? and start recognizing that
                life happens to all of us. It makes everything easier, including your ability to
                accept others and accept all that life will bring.”
