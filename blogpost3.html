            <h2>Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, blockchain... So what does it all mean?</h2>
            <p>
                Let's start with some quick definitions. Blockchain is the technology that enables the existence of
                cryptocurrency (among other things). Bitcoin is the name of the best-known cryptocurrency, the one for
                which blockchain technology was invented. A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange, such as the US
                dollar, but is digital and uses encryption techniques to control the creation of monetary units and to
                verify the transfer of funds. </p>
            <h2> What is blockchain technology?</h2>
            <p>
                A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network. Using this
                technology, participants can confirm transactions without a need for a central clearing authority.
                Potential applications can include fund transfers, settling trades, voting, and many other issues.
            </p>
            <h2>Blockchain also has potential applications far beyond bitcoin and cryptocurrency.</h2>
            <p>
                
                From a business perspective, it’s helpful to think of blockchain technology as a type of next-generation
                business process improvement software. Collaborative technology, such as blockchain, promises the
                ability to improve the business processes that occur between companies, radically lowering the “cost of
                trust.” For this reason, it may offer significantly higher returns for each investment dollar spent than
                most traditional internal investments.
            </p>
            <p>

                Financial institutions are exploring how they could also use blockchain technology to upend everything
                from clearing and settlement to insurance. These articles will help you understand these changes—and
                what you should do about them.
            </p>
            <p>

                For an overview of cryptocurrency, start with Money is no object. We explore the early days of bitcoin
                and provide survey data on consumer familiarity, usage, and more. We also look at how market
                participants, such as investors, technology providers, and financial institutions, will be affected as
                the market matures..
